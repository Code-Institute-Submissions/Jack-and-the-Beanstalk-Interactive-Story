## Jack-and-the-Beanstalk-Interactive-Story
This is an interactive story about the famous Jack and the Beanstalk.

I want to make it easy to read the story section by section, instead of scrolling thru a whole story in a long and a boring text layout. 

### Deployment
The project is hosted on Github Pages at  
https://rawa08.github.io/Jack-and-the-Beanstalk-Interactive-Story/


### UX
I made the layout simple and clean, with minimum amount of buttons.  
I made also a section counter to track in witch chapter the reader is.

### Features

The user is able to navigate thru the sections with the Next and Previous buttons.  
The section counter helps to keep track of the reading.

### Technologies Used
The website is developed in HTML 5, CSS 3 and Javascript ES6.
##### Libraries:
Bootstrap v4.3  
jQuery v3.4.1

### Testing
The website responsiveness and functionality was tested on:  
Safari on apple mobile devices (Iphone 6, 8plus, xr, xs, 11 pro Max).  
Chrome for android (SM-Galaxy s10+, Huawei p30 pro ).  
Chrome for Mac and PC.  
Safari for Mac.  

##### Validation:
